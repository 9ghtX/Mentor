# Characters Mentor
This is an application for storing, editing and playing characters in any roleplay system.
The idea of this project is to create an app that would by flexible, easy to use and could be reconstructed and edited to fetch any roleplay system neither it will be GURPS, D&D or custom.

## About
Character Mentor is made in WPF in 6 .NET, using MVVM architecture for making is flexible.
I separate View's (that represents different UI modules, for example Headet with character info or Inventory with editing options) from each other to give an oppotrunity to make your own and use them in your purpose.
By that I mean that in D&D and GURPS, for example, there will be difference in Inventory system. In D&D there is no LC or some additional propetries for items, so as you don't need them you can create (or in this case just remove not usebale stuff) our own Inventory Module and use it in this app.

### Supporting
As this project is for helping roleplay gamers, I'll try to make some guides for developing your custom UI and making/editing modules. On other words, I will tell about architecture of an app and how to implement your mechanincs and connect them to UI.

### If you can help...
If you will see any issues in an app or your have suggestions - please, leave them in Issue section of this project or contact me in Discord - 9ghtX#3272.
Also it would be nice if you'll help with development (even it would be just answering questions).
